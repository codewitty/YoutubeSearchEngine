In today's video I talk about the Pros and the Cons of the university of California, Irvine. Many people are curious to know more about UCI and want to know about the good and the bad, so I thought this video would be perfect to make. With everything going on in the world right now, I have been staying busy and distracted and creating this youtube video and other content is an outlet for me. I separated the video into Social Cons, Academic Cons, Social Pros, and Academic Pros so that way you all have a broader perspective of UC Irvine. If you have any questions please feel free to leave them in the comment section below so that I can try an help you out!

My UC Irvine Experience & What Academics, Financial Aid, and Social Life are like at Irvine!	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqd5odHyJBw	913	2021-04-26T07:24:25Z	UCI,UC Irvine,University of California	"Whats up yall! Here's a little insight into my experience at UC Irvine as a first-generation student and connected alumni. I personally never knew much about UC Irvine when I initially applied so when I got accepted with a full-ride and decided to enroll there were a lot of unknowns but it turned out to be one of the best decisions I've made. Things I touch up on in the video are academics, financial aid, and the social life here at the University of California Irvine. College is what you make of it so explore, have fun and grind to get to where you want. Enjoy!

NEW PODCAST
Being a first-generation student, my goal is to share how I've managed to get where I am at so that others can learn and find their own version of success. The first generation experience is unique and through every challenge I've come across, I've learned something each time to level up. I go into more of these details in my podcast FirstGen Millionaire on Spotify, check it out!
